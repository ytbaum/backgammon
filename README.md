backgammon
==========

This is my own implementation of Backgammon.

It currently only runs from the console.  Moves are made by typing in an origin space and a destination space,
separated by whitespace.  The spaces are zero-indexed (i.e. they are integers ranging from 0 to 23), starting
at the top right corner of the board and going counter-clockwise.  To end a turn, the user needs to type "pass"
at the command line.
